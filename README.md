`isbetmf` is a [TM Forum (TMF) Open API](https://www.tmforum.org/oda/open-apis/directory) server written in Go. It is designed to be highly flexible and compliant with TMF standards.

## Features

*   **Dual Operation Modes:**
    *   **Standalone Server:** Implements TMF Open API specifications using a local SQLite database.
    *   **Proxy Server:** Acts as a gateway in front of a remote TMF API server.
*   **Policy Enforcement:** Acts as a Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) and Policy Decision Point (PDP), enforcing authentication and fine-grained authorization using Starlark scripts.
*   **Reporting & Validation:** Includes a dedicated tool (`tmf-reporting`) for validating TMF API implementations and generating compliance reports.
*   **Replication:** Supports data replication capabilities (see `replicate` directory).
*   **Conformance:** Passes the official TMF Conformance Test Kit for TMF V4 and V5 APIs.
*   **Zero-Downtime Updates:** Uses `tableflip` for graceful restarts and upgrades.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) 1.21 or higher
*   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (optional, for containerized deployment)
*   [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (optional, for build automation)

### Local Development

To run the server locally for development:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hesusruiz/isbetmf.git
    cd isbetmf
    ```

2.  **Run with default configuration:**
    ```bash
    go run main.go -run mycredential
    ```
    Or using Make:
    ```bash
    make run
    ```
    This starts the server using the `mycredential` profile (configured in `config/config_data.go`), which typically uses a local SQLite database.

3.  **Build the binaries:**
    ```bash
    make build          # Builds the server (bin/isbetmf)
    make build-reporting # Builds the reporting tool (bin/tmf-reporting)
    ```

4.  **Run Tests:**
    ```bash
    make test
    ```

### Docker Deployment

The application is designed to be containerized.

1.  **Build the container:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t isbetmf .
    ```

2.  **Run the container:**
    The container requires the `ISBETMF_RUN_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable to select the configuration profile.
    ```bash
    docker run -e ISBETMF_RUN_ENVIRONMENT=isbedev -p 9991:9991 isbetmf
    ```
    Possible values for `ISBETMF_RUN_ENVIRONMENT`: `isbedev`, `isbepre`, `isbepro`, `domedev`, `domepre`, `domepro`.

## Configuration

### Profiles

Configuration is managed via profiles defined in `config/config_data.go`. This approach reduces configuration errors by grouping settings into well-defined environments.

To add or modify a profile, edit `config/config_data.go`. You can specify the profile to use at runtime with the `-run` flag:
```bash
./bin/isbetmf -run <profile_name>
```

### Policy Engine (PDP)

Authorization rules are defined in Starlark scripts (e.g., `auth_policies.star`). This allows for dynamic and complex permission logic without recompiling the server. The PDP evaluates these rules for every request to determine access.

## Architecture

The project follows a clean, layered architecture:

1.  **Entrypoint (`main.go`):** Handles initialization, config loading, and graceful restarts.
2.  **Handler Layer (`tmfserver/handler/fiber`):** Manages HTTP requests using Fiber, translating them into transport-agnostic service requests. Handles generic TMF routing.
3.  **Service Layer (`tmfserver/service`):** Contains the core business logic, decoupled from HTTP. Handles authentication, authorization (via PDP), and orchestration.
4.  **Repository Layer (`tmfserver/repository`):** Abstracts database interactions (SQLite).
5.  **Policy Engine (`pdp`):** Executes Starlark rules for authorization.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`).
3.  Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`).
4.  Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`).
5.  Open a Pull Request.

Please ensure you run tests (`make test`) and lint your code (`make lint`) before submitting.
